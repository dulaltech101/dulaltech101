- 👋 Hi, I'm a recent MIS (Management Information System) graduate looking to start a career in data and analytics field. 
- 🌱 Over the year, I came to understand the importance of data and analytical skills in the decision-making process, automating decisions, and solving the complex challenges of the 21st century. I'm currently looking to gain professional experience in information systems/data science. 
- During the summer of 2021, I completed the MIT - Applied Data Science program and used Python libraries such as Numpy, Pandas, Matloplib, Skitlearn, Tensorflow, and Keras. The program was extensive and intensive, with 6 hands-on industry-relevant projects and 1 capstone project based on computer vision (deep learning).
