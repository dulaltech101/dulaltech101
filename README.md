- 👋 Hi, I'm a Management Information System (MIS) & Management (emphasis on organizational leadership) - double major senior student with +3 years of experience in the field of finance, residential real estate, and regulatory compliances.
- 👀 Inspiring others to do more/better has been an organic process for me. As a project lead/quality lead II, I have led the team to renovate the residential units' interior, minimize the rejects, improve product quality, and meet the regulatory compliances.
- 🌱 Over the year, I came to understand the importance of data and analytical skills in the decision-making process, automating decisions, and solving the complex challenges of the 21st century. I'm currently looking to gain professional experience in information systems, data science, and/or cybersecurity.
- During the summer of 2021, I completed the MIT - Applied Data Science program and used Python libraries such as Numpy, Pandas, Matloplib, Skitlearn, Tensorflow, and Keras. The program was extensive and intensive, with 6 hands-on industry-relevant projects and 1 capstone project based on computer vision (deep learning). I'd like to express my heartfelt appreciation to my family members, MIT professors, GL mentors (experienced data science practitioners), and incredible peers.

- 💞️ My other areas of interest/hobbies are hiking & landscape photography, content analysis & creation, creative writing, cinema, and community involvement.
